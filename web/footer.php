<h3>The story behind #TheDress</h3>
<p>Here's #TheDress which broke the internet and it all started when <em>swiked</em> uploaded this photo on her tumblr page and then buzzfeed published the story. The internet is ablaze about the dress and we thought we'll conduct a poll on how many were <em>"<strong>deceived</strong>"</em> by the colour of the dress. Arent you a bit keen about how other people in the world saw it? LET'S FIND OUT!</p>
